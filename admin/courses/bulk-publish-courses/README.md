# Bulk Publish Courses

This adds the ability to bulk publish courses from the Admin Courses search area. This will require permissions to publish courses to work and is currently restricted to the 'AccountAdmin' role.

Use the course search to add the desired search criteria for the courses that will appear to potentially publish. The modal that opens will have a button to load in all unpublished courses based on the current search criteria. Courses can be unchecked to exclude them from being published. After reviewing the courses to be published, you can click the 'Publish' button and then confirm to begin publishing the selected courses. The loading messages will provide updates on the progress and removes selected rows when the course is successfully published.

It is highly recommended to use the search criteria first so there are fewer courses to review that don't need to be published. In addition, depending on how broad the search criteria is and/or the sub-account where this is being used, it may result in significantly longer loading times to load the unpublished courses and/or to publish the selected courses. Remember to stay on the page and don't refresh until the process completes. Leaving the page and/or reloading the page will cause the process to stop running.
