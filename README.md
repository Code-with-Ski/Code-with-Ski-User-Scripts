# Code-with-Ski-User-Scripts

This is a collection of user scripts that can be used with the Canvas LMS. These scripts have the potential to create, update, and/or delete data in the Canvas LMS. The actions performed by these scripts are only able to do things that your user account has permission to do. These scripts are provided as is and should be used at your own risk. While I do test these scripts before releasing them, there may be unexpected edge cases that I miss and will do my best to update and account for when notified of these issues. It is recommended that you review the code before use and ensure your school gives permission for you to use these scripts. If possible, it is also recommended to run your own tests on your Beta/Test server and/or with test courses before using it for the first time to ensure it behaves as expected in your site.

To use these scripts you will need to use a browser extension that provides support for user scripts (such as TamperMonkey), set-up your own local browser extension, and/or add it to the JavaScript theme customization for your Canvas environment. \*If adding it to your Canvas Theme, you may want to add additional checks to limit access to select admin and/or user roles.
